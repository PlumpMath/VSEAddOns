# Video Sequence Editor Add Ons
This is my collection of Plugins for Blender3D's Video Sequence Editor. They
aim to add feature which are common in other video editors to make blender the
best open source video editor out there.

## Transform (transform.py)
This script by kgeogeo & DoubleZ allows grabbing, scaling and rotating strips
in the preview window.

## Composite (composite.py)
Assists in the creation of video compositions with presets for keying,
pixelizing and 3D animations.

## Text (text.py)
Creates a scene with a text and allows simple editing in the sequencer.

## Scene tools (sceentools.py)
Will in the future be availlable for handling and prerendering scene strips.

## Record (record.py)
Will in the future be availlable to record audio in blender.
